INFORMATION FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN ALTERING THE MODULE

If you are interested in altering the module, please note that the
installed version is automatically created from a master version. All
of the scripts to create the installed version are in the directory
"boot" of the distribution. You need to run the scripts from the
command line from the top directory.

FILES

The files are as follows (all file names are qualified with respect to
the topmost directory of the distribution):

WWWJDIC.pm

This is the master version of the module. It runs in place under a
condition "use WWWJDIC;" rather than the qualified name. It does not
contain a $VERSION variable and the documentation is incomplete.

boot/mybuild.pl

This transforms the development version of the module into the
installed version.

boot/cleanup.pl

This removes all the files created by "boot/mybuild.pl".

boot/Boot.pm

A module which helps the above modules.

boot/VERSION

This contains the version number of the module only.

boot/README.in

This is the master file for the author name, module name, module
description, and everything else except the version number.

WHY?

The reason that this module has the above structure is to avoid any
kind of repetition of information. For example, the version number
exists in exactly one place, the file "boot/VERSION", and nowhere
else, to avoid maintenance headaches as versions change. The script
"mybuild.pl" copies this version information into every other file.
