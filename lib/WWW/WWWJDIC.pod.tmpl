=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("synopsis") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Get information about the WWWJDIC online Japanese dictionaries.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_mirrors

    my %mirrors = get_mirrors ();

Get a list of mirrors of WWWJDIC. The keys are arbitrary identifiers,
and the values are the URLs of the mirrors.  As of this version, the
following sites are available:

=over
[% FOR mirror IN wwwjdicinfo.mirrors.keys.sort %]
=item [% mirror %]

L<[% wwwjdicinfo.mirrors.$mirror %]>
[% END %]
=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $wwwjdic = WWW::WWWJDIC->new (mirror => "japan")

Create the object which extracts the information from WWWJDIC. 

The arguments are a hash with the following keys:

=over

=item mirror

Set the mirror site to use for L</lookup_url>. The possible values can
be obtained from L</get_mirrors>. If you do not specify a mirror, the
current default value is C<usa>.

Please note that mirrors may change or go out of service, and new
mirrors may be created. The above mirrors are obtained using the
script F<boot/scrape-json.pl> in the git repository. This script is
not part of the CPAN distribution.

=back

=head2 lookup_url

    my $url = $wwwjdic->lookup_url ($key);

Make a lookup url (the "backdoor URL") which links to a WWWJDIC
page. As of version [% info.version %], this URL goes to the combined
dictionary page.

=head1 BUGS

=over

=item *

Mirrors (including the main edrdg one) frequently go out of service.

=item *

The return value of L</lookup_url> may become invalid as WWWJDIC's
options are often changed so that different letters and numbers are
used to indicate the various dictionaries.

=item *

There is no way to set the dictionary in L</lookup_url>.

=item *

There is no way to get the URL for the plain text output of WWWJDIC.

=back

=head1 HISTORY

I started this module as a scraper for the WWWJDIC web site in around
2009. I released it to CPAN in 2017, but with documentation unwritten
and with scraper code which no longer worked. Currently the only
active use I have for this module is to get the list of mirrors. In
version 0.003 I removed the scraper code, leaving only the method
L</lookup_url> and the function L</get_mirrors>.
