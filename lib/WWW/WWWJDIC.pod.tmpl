=head1 NAME

WWW::WWWJDIC - Get information from online Japanese dictionary WWWJDIC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("synopsis") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Get information about the WWWJDIC online Japanese dictionaries.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_mirrors

    my %mirrors = get_mirrors ();

Get a list of mirrors of WWWJDIC. The keys are arbitrary identifiers,
and the values are the URLs of the mirrors.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $wwwjdic = WWW::WWWJDIC->new (mirror => "japan")

Create the object which extracts the information from WWWJDIC. 

The arguments are a hash with the following keys:

=over

=item mirror

Set the mirror site to use for L</lookup_url>. The possible values can
be obtained from L</get_mirrors>. As of this version, the following
sites are available:

=over
[% FOR mirror IN wwwjdicinfo.mirrors.keys %]
=item [% mirror %]

[% wwwjdicinfo.mirrors.$mirror %]
[% END %]
=back

If you do not specify a mirror, the current default value is C<usa>.

Please note that mirrors may change or go out of service, and new
mirrors may be created. The above mirrors are obtained using the
script F<boot/scrape-json.pl> in the git repository. This script is
not part of the CPAN distribution.

=back

=head2 lookup_url

    my $url = $wwwjdic->lookup_url ($key, $search_type);

For example,

[% example("look-up-url") %]

Make a lookup url (the "backdoor URL") which links to a WWWJDIC page.

=head1 BUGS

Mirrors (including the main edrdg one) frequently go out of service.

=head1 HISTORY

I started this module as a scraper for the WWWJDIC web site in around
2009. I released it to CPAN in 2017, but with documentation unwritten
and with scraper code which no longer worked. Currently the only
active use I have for this module is to get the list of mirrors. In
version 0.003 I removed the scraper code, leaving only the method
L</lookup_url> and the function L</get_mirrors>.
